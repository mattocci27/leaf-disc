  abstract = {Globally, conifer dominance is restricted to nutient-poor habitats in colder, drier or waterlogged environments, probably due to competition with angiosperms. Analysis of canopy structure is important for understanding the mechanism of plant coexistence in relation to competition for light. Most conifers are shade intolerant, and often have narrow, deep, conical crowns. In this study it is predicted that conifer-admixed forests have less distinct upper canopies and more undulating canopy surfaces than angiosperm-dominated forests.By using a ground-based, portable light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system, canopy structure was quantified for old-growth evergreen rainforests with varying dominance of conifers along altitudinal gradients (200\textendash 3100 m a.s.l.) on tropical and sub-tropical mountains (Mount Kinabalu, Malaysian Borneo and Yakushima Island, Japan) that have different conifer floras.Conifers dominated at higher elevations on both mountains (Podocarpaceae and Araucariaceae on Kinabalu and Cupressaceae and Pinaceae on Yakushima), but conifer dominance also varied with soil/substrate conditions on Kinabalu. Conifer dominance was associated with the existence of large-diameter conifers. Forests with higher conifer dominance showed a canopy height profile (CHP) more skewed towards the understorey on both Kinabalu and Yakushima. In contrast, angiosperm-dominated forests had a CHP skewed towards upper canopy, except for lowland dipterocarp forests and a sub-alpine scrub dominated by small-leaved Leptospermum recurvum (Myrtaceae) on Kinabalu. Forests with a less dense upper canopy had more undulating outer canopy surfaces. Mixed conifer\textendash angiosperm forests on Yakushima and dipterocarp forests on Kinabalu showed similar canopy structures.The results generally supported the prediction, suggesting that lower growth of angiosperm trees (except L. recurvum on Kinabalu) in cold and nutrient-poor environments results in a sparser upper canopy, which allows shade-intolerant conifers to co-occur with angiosperm trees either as emergents or as codominants in the open canopy.},

  abstract = {P{$>$}1. Functional traits are increasingly used to investigate community\textbackslash nstructure, ecosystem functioning or to classify species into functional\textbackslash ngroups. These functional traits are expected to be variable between and\textbackslash nwithin species. Intraspecific functional variability is supposed to\textbackslash ninfluence and modulate species responses to environmental changes and\textbackslash ntheir effects on their environment. However, this hypothesis remains\textbackslash npoorly tested and species are mostly described by mean trait values\textbackslash nwithout any consideration of variability in individual trait values.\textbackslash n2. In this study, we quantify the extent of intraspecific plant\textbackslash nfunctional trait variability, its spatial structure and its response to\textbackslash nenvironmental factors. Using a sampling design structured along two\textbackslash ndirect and orthogonal climatic gradients in an alpine valley, we\textbackslash nquantified and analysed the intraspecific variability for three\textbackslash nfunctional traits (height, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen\textbackslash ncontent) measured on sixteen plant species with contrasting life\textbackslash nhistories.\textbackslash n3. Results showed a large variability of traits within species with\textbackslash nlarge discrepancies between functional traits and species. This\textbackslash nvariability did not appear to be structured within populations. Between\textbackslash npopulations, the overall variability was partly explained by the\textbackslash nselected gradients. Despite the strong effects of temperature and\textbackslash nradiation on trait intraspecific variability, the response curves of\textbackslash ntraits along gradients were partly idiosyncratic.\textbackslash n4.Synthesis. Giving a comprehensive quantification of intraspecific\textbackslash nfunctional variability through the analysis of an original data set, we\textbackslash nreport new evidence that using a single trait value to describe a given\textbackslash nspecies can hide large functional variation for this species along\textbackslash nenvironmental gradients. These findings suggest that intraspecific\textbackslash nfunctional variability should be a concern for ecologists and its\textbackslash nrecognition opens new opportunities to better understand and predict\textbackslash necological patterns in a changing environment. Further analyses are,\textbackslash nhowever, required to compare inter- and intraspecific variability.},

  abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

  abstract = {Question: A set of easily-measured ('soft') plant traits has been identified as potentially useful predictors of ecosystem functioning in previous studies. Here we aimed to discover whether the screening techniques remain operational in widely contrasted circumstances, to test for the existence of axes of variation in the particular sets of traits, and to test for their links with 'harder' traits of proven importance to ecosystem functioning. Location: central-western Argentina, central England, northern upland Iran, and north-eastern Spain. Recurrent patterns of ecological specialization: Through ordination of a matrix of 640 vascular plant taxa by 12 standardized traits, we detected similar patterns of specialization in the four floras. The first PCA axis was identified as an axis of resource capture, usage and release. PCA axis 2 appeared to be a size-related axis. Individual PCA for each country showed that the same traits remained valuable as predictors of resource capture and utilization in all of them, despite their major differences in climate, biogeography and land-use. The results were not significantly driven by particular taxa: the main traits determining PCA axis 1 were very similar in eudicotyledons and monocotyledons and Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Links between recurrent suites of 'soft' traits and 'hard' traits: The validity of PCA axis 1 as a key predictor of resource capture and utilization was tested by comparisons between this axis and values of more rigorously established predictors ('hard' traits) for the floras of Argentina and England. PCA axis 1 was correlated with variation in relative growth rate, leaf nitrogen content, and litter decomposition rate. It also coincided with palatability to model generalist herbivores. Therefore, location on PCA axis 1 can be linked to major ecosystem processes in those habitats where the plants are dominant. Conclusion: We confirm the existence at the global scale of a major axis of evolutionary specialization, previously recognised in several local floras. This axis reflects a fundamental trade-off between rapid acquisition of resources and conservation of resources within well-protected tissues. These major trends of specialization were maintained across different environmental situations (including differences in the proximate causes of low productivity, i.e. drought or mineral nutrient deficiency). The trends were also consistent across floras and major phylogenetic groups, and were linked with traits directly relevant to ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {Earth is home to a remarkable diversity of plant forms and life histories, yet comparatively few essential trait combinations have proved evolutionarily viable in today's terrestrial biosphere. By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three- quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.},

However, it remains unclear how\textemdash and even if\textemdash such traits influence whole-plant growth, with the simple linear relationships predicted by existing theory often lacking empirical support. Here, we present a theoretical framework for understanding the effect of diverse functional traits on plant growth and shade tolerance by extending a widely used model, linking growth rate in seedlings with a single leaf trait, to explicitly include influences of size, light environment, and five prominent traits: seed mass, height at maturation, leaf mass per unit leaf area, leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area, and wood density. Based on biomass growth and allocation, this framework explains why the influence of traits on growth rate and shade tolerance often varies with plant size and why the impact of size on growth varies among traits. Specifically, we demonstrate why for height growth the influence of: (i) leaf mass per unit leaf area is strong in small plants but weakens with size; (ii) leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area does not change with size; (iii) wood density is present across sizes; (iv) height at maturation strengthens with size; and (v) seed mass decreases with size. Moreover, we show how traits moderate plant responses to light environment and also determine shade tolerance, supporting diverse empirical results.},

However, knowledge on carbon exchanges, their spatio-temporal patterns, and the extent of the key controls that affect carbon fluxes is lacking. In this study, we employed 29-site-years of eddy covariance data to observe the state, spatio-temporal variations and climate sensitivity of carbon fluxes (gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Reco), and net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE)) in four representative forest ecosystems in Yunnan. We found that 1) all four forest ecosystems were carbon sinks (the average NEE was -3.40tCha-1yr-1); 2) contrasting seasonality of the NEE among the ecosystems with a carbon sink mainly during the wet season in the Yuanjiang savanna ecosystem (YJ) but during the dry season in the Xishuangbanna tropical rainforest ecosystem (XSBN), besides an equivalent NEE uptake was observed during the wet/dry season in the Ailaoshan subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest ecosystem (ALS) and Lijiang subalpine coniferous forest ecosystem (LJ); 3) as the GPP increased, the net ecosystem production (NEP) first increased and then decreased when the GPP{$>$}17.5tCha-1yr-1; 4) the precipitation determines the carbon sinks in the savanna ecosystem (e.g., YJ), while temperature did so in the tropical forest ecosystem (e.g., XSBN); 5) overall, under the circumstances of warming and decreased precipitation, the carbon sink might decrease in the YJ but maybe increase in the ALS and LJ, while future strength of the sink in the XSBN is somewhat uncertain. However, based on the redundancy analysis, the temperature and precipitation combined together explained 39.7\%, 32.2\%, 25.3\%, and 29.6\% of the variations in the NEE in the YJ, XSBN, ALS and LJ, respectively, which indicates that considerable changes in the NEE could not be explained by variations in the temperature and precipitation. Therefore, the effects of other factors (e.g., CO2 concentration, N/P deposition, aerosol and other variables) on the NEE still require extensive research and need to be considered seriously in carbon-cycle-models.},

In this review we highlight the specific photosynthetic machinery present in C3 vascular cells, which likely evolved prior to the divergence between C3 and C4 plants. The associated primary processes of carbon recapture, nitrogen transport, and antioxidant metabolism are discussed. This review of the basal C4 photosynthesis in C3 plants is significant in the context of promoting the potential for biotechnological development of C4-transgenic rice crops.},

Leaf transverse sections of seven annual-perennial pairs of grass species grown in the laboratory were analyzed to elucidate the anatomical bases of these differences. Leaf thickness was similar in annuals and perennials, but leaf density was significantly higher in perennials. The proportion of the leaf volume occupied by mesophyll was higher in annuals, at the expense of the three other tissues (i.e. epidermis, sclerenchyma and vascular tissues). The cross-sectional area of mesophyll cells was higher in annuals than in perennials, but epidermal cell size was similar for both life-forms. The ranges of LSM (23.1-49.5 g m(-2)) and LWC (0.70-0.86 g g(-1)) displayed by the 14 species were large enough to examine the general relationships between these two parameters and various anatomical characters. LSM was significantly correlated with leaf density, but not with leaf thickness. The anatomical character that best explained interspecific differences in LSM was the volume of cell walls per unit leaf area (approximated by the sum: sclerechyma + vascular tissues (including its living component) + cell wall components of mesophyll and epidermis). LWC was found to depend on leaf density, and interspecific differences in this parameter were best explained by the proportion of mesophyll protoplast (i.e. proportion of mesophyll minus proportion of mesophyll occupied by cell walls) in the transverse sections. The physiological and ecological implications of these findings are discussed in terms of a trade-off between leaf productivity and persistence.},

As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-\$t\$ prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

In a comparative field study of 171 plant species in 174 grassland sites across China, we examined the trade-offs, defined as negative covariance between two traits, between leaf persistence (leaf mass per area, LMA) and leaf productivity (mass-based photosynthetic rate, Amass, N and P content, and photosynthetic N use efficiency, PNUE). We asked to which extent these trade-offs were influenced by: (1) variation among sites within species, decomposed into variation due to climatic and soil variables; (2) variation among species within sites, decomposed into variation among taxonomic, functional, or phylogenetic groups; and (3) the joint contribution of variation among species and sites. We used mixed-model analysis of covariance to partition bivariate relationships between leaf traits into trade-off components. We found significant mass-based persistence-productivity trade-offs of LMA-Amass, LMA-N, LMA-P, and LMA-PNUE consistent with previous broadscale findings. Overall, (1) variation among sites within species explained 14-23\%, (2) variation among species within sites explained 20-34\%, and (3) the two together explained 42-63\% of the total covariance between leaf traits. Interspecific trade-offs of LMA-Amass, LMA-N, and LMA-P were stronger than inter-site ones. A relatively low amount of covariance was explained by climatic and soil variables. However, we found the trade-offs were stronger for LMA-N and LMA-P at higher precipitation and for LMA-PNUE at greater soil fertility, if displayed by major axis regression, which combined both intra- and interspecific variation. Residual trade-offs within species and sites were weak, suggesting that intraspecific, intra-site variation in physiology was less important than variation imposed by species identity or environmental differences among sites. Our results from grassland biomes add evidence for the fundamental nature of productivity-persistence trade-offs in plants. No individual factor emerged as the single major cause for these trade-offs. Rather, the total covariance between leaf traits was explained by a combination of factors, each contributing a range of explanatory power.},

Here, we quantify these drivers in a field study of 171 plant species in 174 sites across Chinese grasslands, including the Tibetan Plateau, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang. General linear models were used to partition leaf trait variation. Of the total variation in leaf traits, on average 27\% is due to taxonomic or phylogenetic differences among species within sites (pure species effect), 29\% to variation among sites within species (pure site effect), 38\% to joint effects of taxonomic and environmental factors (shared effect), and 6.2\% to within-site and within-species variation. Examining the pure site effect, climate explained 7.8\%, soil explained 7.4\%, and climate and soil variables together accounted for 11\%, leaving 18\% of the inter-site variation due to factors other than climate or soil. The results do not support the hypothesis that soil fertility is the ``missing link'' to explain leaf trait variation unexplained by climatic factors. Climate- and soil-induced leaf adaptations occur mostly among species, and leaf traits vary little within species in Chinese grassland plants, despite strongly varying climate and soil conditions.},

In addition to differences in their biochemistry, photosynthetic organs of C4 plants show alterations in their anatomy and ultrastructure4. Little is known about whether the biochemical or anatomical characteristics of C4 photosynthesis evolved first. Here we report that tobacco, a typical C3 plant, shows characteristics of C4 photosynthesis in cells of stems and petioles that surround the xylem and phloem, and that these cells are supplied with carbon for photosynthesis from the vascular system and not from stomata. These photosynthetic cells possess high activities of enzymes characteristic of C4 photosynthesis, which allow the decarboxylation of four-carbon organic acids from the xylem and phloem, thus releasing CO2 for photosynthesis. These biochemical characteristics of C4 photosynthesis in cells around the vascular bundles of stems of C3 plants might explain why C4 photosynthesis has evolved independently many times.},

On Yakushima, total stand basal area abruptly increased from 700 to 1,050 m in accordance with the high dominance of conifers, indicating the presence of additive basal area of conifers in conifer\textendash broadleaf mixed forests at higher elevations (1,050\textendash 1,300 m). Along two substrate series on Kinabalu, some forests at higher elevations (1,860\textendash 3,080 m) showed relatively high dominance of conifers, but conifer basal area did not appear to be additive. Conifers were emergents above the canopy of broadleaf trees in mixed forests on Yakushima, but two life forms usually coexisted in the single-story canopy in mixed forests on Kinabalu. Litterfall rate as a surrogate of productivity decreased with decreasing temperature along elevation on both the sites, but the rate of decrease was slower on Yakushima, where mixed forests at higher elevations showed relatively high rates. Thus, we suggest that additive basal area of conifers was linked to their emergent status, and that it enhanced productivity by complementary use of light by two life forms that occupy different stories. On Yakushima, typhoons are a major disturbance, but do not severely limit the height growth of conifers, allowing the development of two-story mixed forests. On Kinabalu, a major disturbance is El Ni\~no-driven drought, and hydraulic limitation to tree height may explain the non-additive and non-emergent nature of conifers.},

Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the TRY database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the TRY database also supports new frontiers of trait-based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in TRY and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits?almost complete coverage for ?plant growth form?. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait?environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the TRY database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives.},

  abstract = {1. Despite widespread focus on interspecific variation in trait-based ecology, there is growing evidence that intraspecific trait variability can play a fundamental role in plant community responses to environmental change and community assembly. 2. Here, we quantify the strength and direction of inter- and intraspecific plant community trait responses along a 900 m elevation gradient spanning alpine and subalpine plant commu- nities in southern New Zealand. We measured five commonly used leaf traits (i.e. dry matter content, N and P concentrations, leaf area and specific leaf area) on all 31 dominant and sub- ordinate species recorded along the gradient, and examined their species-specific and commu- nity-level responses to elevation using both abundance-weighted and nonweighted averages of trait values. 3. By decomposing the variance of community-level measures of these traits across the gradi- ent, we showed that the contribution of interspecific variation to the response of plant assem- blages to elevation was stronger than that of intraspecific variation, for all traits except specific leaf area. Further, the relative contributions of interspecific effects were greater when abun- dance-weighted rather than nonweighted measures were used. We also observed contrasting intraspecific trait responses to the gradient among species (particularly for leaf N and P con- centrations), and found both positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific effects on community-level trait values. 4. The weak community-average trait responses to elevation, as found for specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf N and P concentrations, resulted from strong but opposing responses among vs. within species, which are not typically accounted for in species-based measures of plant community responses. For instance, increasing elevation (and associated factors such as a decrease in soil nutrient availability) favoured the dominance of species with relatively high leaf nutrient concentrations while simultaneously triggering an intraspecific decrease in the leaf nutrient concentrations of these species. 5. The context dependency of positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspe- cific trait variability, and the species-specific nature of intraspecific shifts in functional trait values, reveal highly complex plastic responses of plants to environmental changes, and high- lights the need for greater consideration of the role that intraspecific variation plays in commu- nity-level processes},

Methods We tested our hypothesis that contrasting LL\textendash MAT relationships in evergreen and deciduous species result from differing adaptations to variation in the length of the annual favourable period.We defined f as the portion of the year when monthly temperature and water availability were favourable.We examined whether the contrasting LL patterns with MAT can be also seen with f. Next, we calculated the optimal LL that maximizes carbon gain per unit time across a range of f. Results The contrasting LL patterns across MAT were also found across f. Our optimizationmodel successfully reproduced the contrasting LL patterns across f for the evergreen (LL longer than 1 year) and deciduous plants. Themodel shows that longer LL is required to maximize carbon gain for evergreen plants in shorter f, while LL of deciduous plants decreases with decreasing f.Without any a priori trait association, the model reproduced the well-known LL\textendash leaf mass per area (LMA) relationship. The model also reproduced observed shifts in LL\textendash LMA relationships across MAT or f. Evergreen leaves in long f need greater LMA to maintain LL than those in shorter f. Main conclusions Observed contrasting LL\textendash MAT patterns in deciduous and evergreen species can be reproduced via the simple rule of maximizing carbon gain across different lengths of favourable periods.

Tissue traits (density and fracture toughness of lamina and vein) were correlated positively with each other, but independent of lamina thickness.

Species with dense and tough leaves as saplings also had dense and tough leaves as seedlings and adults. The patterns of ontogenetic change in trait values differed between the seedling-to-sapling and sapling-to-adult transitions.

  abstract = {Leaf physiology determines the carbon acquisition of the whole plant, but there can be considerable variation in physiology and carbon acquisition within individual leaves. Alocasia macrorrhiza (L.) Schott is an herbaceous species that can develop very large leaves of up to 1 m in length. However, little is known about the hydraulic and photosynthetic design of such giant leaves. Based on previous studies of smaller leaves, and on the greater surface area for trait variation in large leaves, we hypothesized that A. macrorrhiza leaves would exhibit significant heterogeneity in structure and function. We found evidence of reduced hydraulic supply and demand in the outer leaf regions; leaf mass per area, chlorophyll concentration, and guard cell length decreased, as did stomatal conductance, net photosynthetic rate and quantum efficiency of photosystem II. This heterogeneity in physiology was opposite to that expected from a thinner boundary layer at the leaf edge, which would have led to greater rates of gas exchange. Leaf temperature was 8.8\textdegree C higher in the outer than in the central region in the afternoon, consistent with reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration caused by a hydraulic limitation to the outer lamina. The reduced stomatal conductance in the outer regions would explain the observed homogeneous distribution of leaf water potential across the leaf surface. These findings indicate substantial heterogeneity in gas exchange across the leaf surface in large leaves, greater than that reported for smaller-leafed species, though the observed structural differences across the lamina were within the range reported for smaller-leafed species. Future work will determine whether the challenge of transporting water to the outer regions can limit leaf size for plants experiencing drought, and whether the heterogeneity of function across the leaf surface represents a particular disadvantage for large simple leaves that might explain their global rarity, even in resource-rich environments.},

Recently, a new leaf shape model (referred to as the MLRF equation) derived from temperature-dependent bacterial growth was proposed and demonstrated to be valid in describing leaf boundaries of many species with ovate leaf shape. The MLRF model's parameters can provide valuable information of leaf shape, including the ratio of lamina width to length and the lamina centroid location on the lamina length axis. However, the model wasn't tested on a large sample of a single species, thereby limiting its overall evaluation for describing leaf boundaries, for evaluating lamina bilateral asymmetry and for calculating lamina centroid location. In this study, we further test the model using data from two Lauraceae species, Cinnamomum camphora and Machilus leptophylla, with {$>$}290 leaves for each species. The equation was found to be credible for describing those shapes, with all adjusted root-mean-square errors (RMSE) smaller than 0.05, indicating that the mean absolute deviation is smaller than 5\% of the radius of an assumed circle whose area equals lamina area. It was also found that the larger the extent of lamina asymmetry, the larger the adjusted RMSE, with approximately 50\% of unexplained variation by the model accounted for by the lamina asymmetry, implying that this model can help to quantify the leaf bilateral asymmetry in future studies. In addition, there was a significant difference between the two species in their centroid ratio, i.e., the distance from leaf petiole to the point on the lamina length axis associated with leaf maximum width to the leaf maximum length. It was found that a higher centroid ratio does not necessarily lead to a greater investment of mass to leaf petiole relative to lamina, which might depend on the petiole pattern.},

  abstract = {The principle of similarity (Thompson, \textexclamdown xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53"\textquestiondown 1917\textexclamdown/xref\textquestiondown ) states that the weight of an organism follows the 3/2-power law of its surface area and is proportional to its volume on the condition that the density is constant. However, the allometric relationship between leaf weight and leaf area has been reported to greatly deviate from the 3/2-power law, with the irregularity of leaf density largely ignored for explaining this deviation. Here, we choose 11 bamboo species to explore the allometric relationships among leaf area (A), density ({$\rho$}), length (L), thickness (T), and weight (W). Because the edge of a bamboo leaf follows a simplified two-parameter Gielis equation, we could show that A {$\propto$} L\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown 2\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} and that A {$\propto$} T\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown 2\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown. This then allowed us to derive the density-thickness allometry {$\rho$} {$\propto$} T\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown b\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} and the weight-area allometry W {$\propto$} A\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown (b+3)/2\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown{} {$\approx$} A\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown 9/8\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown, where b approximates -3/4. Leaf density is strikingly negatively associated with leaf thickness, and it is this inverse relationship that results in the weight-area allometry to deviate from the 3/2-power law. In conclusion, although plants are prone to invest less dry mass and thus produce thinner leaves when the leaf area is sufficient for photosynthesis, such leaf thinning needs to be accompanied with elevated density to ensure structural stability. The findings provide the insights on the evolutionary clue about the biomass investment and output of photosynthetic organs of plants. Because of the importance of leaves, plants could have enhanced the ratio of dry material per unit area of leaf in order to increase the efficiency of photosynthesis, relative the other parts of plants. Although the conclusion is drawn only based on 11 bamboo species, it should also be applicable to the other plants, especially considering previous works on the exponent of the weight-area relationship being less than 3/2 in plants.},

To address this deficiency, we partitioned the variance in two key functional traits (leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content) across six nested ecological scales (site, plot, species, tree, strata and leaf) in lowland tropical rainforests. In both traits, the plot level shows virtually no variance despite high species turnover among plots and the size of within-species variation (leaf + strata + tree) is comparable with that of species level variation. The lack of variance at the plot level brings substantial support to the idea that trait-based environmental filtering plays a central role in plant community assembly. These results and the finding that the amount of within-species variation is comparable with interspecific variation support a shift of focus from species-based to trait-based ecology.},

  abstract = {Trait-based approaches have an increasingly dominant role in community ecology. Although trait-based strategy dimensions such as the leaf economic spectrum (LES) have been identified primarily at global-scales, trait variation at the community scale is often interpreted in this context. Here we argue from several lines of evidence that a research priority should be to determine whether global- scale trait relationships hold at more local scales. We review recent literature assessing trait variation at smaller scales, and then present a case study exploring the relationship between the correlation strength of leaf traits and their similarity in variation structure across ecological scales. We find that the correlation strength between pairs of leaf traits does not predict whether the traits respond similarly to different drivers of variation. Instead, correlation strength only sets an upper bound to the dissimilarity in trait variation structure. With moderate correlation strengths, LES traits largely retain the ability to respond independently to different drivers of phenotypic variation at different scales. Recent literature and our results suggest that LES relationships may not hold at local scales. Clarifying under what conditions and at which scales the LES is consistently expressed is necessary for us to make the most of the emerging trait toolbox.},

The eruption was devastating and it is believed that primary succession and soil formation reinitiated across all altitudes at this point. We hypothesize that the concentrations of soil total phosphorus (P) and labile P fractions increase with increasing altitude because the soil formation has progressed less in upslope areas as a result of the cooler temperature and because of the ample P source of the volcanic ash. Conversely, we hypothesize that the concentration of soil inorganic nitrogen (N) decreases with increasing altitude. Available soil P and N would result in increasing P limitation downslope and increasing N limitation upslope, respectively. We studied soil P fractions and soil inorganic N, and P- and N-use efficiencies of the seven forests on Yakushima along an elevation gradient (170\textendash 1550~m~a.s.l.). Contrary to our hypotheses, soil total P, labile soil P fractions, and inorganic N decreased with increasing altitude. The P- and N-use efficiencies of the forests were negatively correlated with the concentration of soil total active P (total P minus occluded P) and inorganic N, respectively. We suggest that progressive soil acidity and slower decomposition under cooler and wetter environments upslope must have dissolved the P contained in volcanic ash and accelerated P leaching. Forest ecosystems on Yakushima that show a distinct altitudinal zonation are, therefore, characterized by increasing P and N shortage with increasing altitude.},

Within-leaf and within-plant support mass investments were negatively correlated. Therefore, the total plant support fraction was independent of leaf size and lamina dissection. Because of the lower NM of support biomass, the difference in NM between the entire leaf and the photosynthetic lamina increased with leaf size. \textbullet{} We conclude that whole-plant support costs are weakly size-dependent, but accumulation of support structures within the leaf decreases whole-leaf average NM, potentially reducing the integrated photosynthetic activity of larger leaves.},

The percentage of dry mass in mid-rib increased strongly with lamina size, reaching more than 40  \% in the largest laminas. The whole-leaf percentage of mid-rib and petiole increased with leaf size, and the overall support investment was more than 60  \% in the largest leaves. Fractional support investments were generally larger in herbaceous than in woody species and tended to be lower in Mediterranean than in cool temperate and tropical plants. Mid-ribs and petioles had lower N and C percentages, and lower dry to fresh mass ratio, but greater density (mass per unit volume) than laminas. N percentage of lamina without mid-rib was up to 40  \% higher in the largest leaves than the total-lamina (lamina and mid-rib) N percentage, and up to 60  \% higher than whole-leaf N percentage, while lamina density calculated without mid-rib was up to 80  \% less than that with the mid-rib. For all leaf compartments, N percentage was negatively associated with density and dry to fresh mass ratio, while C percentage was positively linked to these characteristics, reflecting the overall inverse scaling between structural and physiological characteristics. However, the correlations between N and C percentages and structural characteristics differed among mid-ribs, petioles and laminas, implying that the mass-weighted average leaf N and C percentage, density, and dry to fresh mass ratio can have different functional values depending on the importance of within-leaf support investments.These data demonstrate that variation in leaf size is associated with major changes in within-leaf support investments and in large modifications in integrated leaf chemical and structural characteristics. These size-dependent alterations can importantly affect general leaf structure vs. function scaling relationships. These data further demonstrate important life-form effects on and climatic differentiation in foliage support costs.},

Six coexisting major tree species in an old-growth temperate forest, Northeast China (i.e., Abies nephrolepis, Pinus koraiensis, Acer mono, Fraxinus mandshurica, Tilia amurensis, and Ulmus laciniata) were sampled, and three habitat types (i.e., Hab I: high soil organic carbon with a moderate slope; Hab II: low soil organic carbon with a gentle slope; and Hab III: low soil organic carbon with a strong slope) were used in the plot. We performed a two-way ANOVA to compare the specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), leaf phosphorus content (LPC), and leaf carbon content (LCC) between saplings (1 {$<$} DBH {$\leq$} 5~cm) and adults (DBH {$\geq$} 10~cm) and between habitat types within species. We simultaneously evaluated the effects of life stage, plant functional type, and habitat type on the six leaf traits. Our results showed that life stage and habitat type had varied influences on the leaf traits of the six species. Life stage was an important determinant for all leaf traits. Plant functional type was included in the best models for SLA, LNC, and LCC. Habitat type had a greater influence on LDMC than SLA. Meanwhile, habitat type had a greater influence on LNC and LPC than LCC. The correlation between leaf traits with local environmental factors varied across different plant functional types and life stages. We suggest conducting individual-based analyses of leaf trait variations according to plant functional type and life stage to understand the plant life strategies along an environmental gradient may improve understanding of the forest dynamics in an old-growth temperate forest.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Leaf mechanical properties, which are important to protect leaves against physical stresses, are thought to change with light and nutrient availabilities. This study aims to understand phenotypic changes of leaf mechanical properties with respect to dry mass allocation and anatomy. METHODS: Leaf lamina strength (maximum force per unit area to fracture), toughness (work to fracture) and stiffness (resistance against deformation) were measured by punch-and-die tests, and anatomical and physiological traits were determined in Plantago major plants grown at different light and nutrient availabilities. A conceptual approach was developed by which punch strength and related carbon costs can be quantitatively related to the underlying anatomical and morphological traits: leaf thickness, dry-mass allocation to cell walls and cell-wall-specific strength. KEY RESULTS: Leaf lamina strength, toughness and stiffness (all expressed on a punch area basis) increased with light availability. By contrast, nutrient availability did not change strength or toughness, but stiffness was higher in low-nutrient plants. Punch strength (maximum force per unit punch area, F(max)/area) was analysed as the product of leaf mass per area (LMA) and F(max)/leaf mass (= punch strength/LMA, indicating mass-use efficiency for strength). The greater strength of sun leaves was mainly explained by their higher LMA. Shade leaves, by contrast, had a higher F(max)/leaf mass. This greater efficiency in shade leaves was caused by a greater fraction of leaf mass in cell walls and by a greater specific strength of cell walls. These differences are probably because epidermis cells constitute a relatively large fraction of the leaf cross-section in shaded leaves. Although a larger percentage of intercellular spaces were found in shade leaves, this in itself did not reduce 'material' strength (punch strength/thickness); it might, however, be important for increasing distance between upper and lower epidermis per unit mass and thus maintaining flexural stiffness at minimal costs. CONCLUSIONS: The consequences of a reduced LMA for punch strength in shaded leaves was partially compensated for by a mechanically more efficient design, which, it is suggested, contributes importantly to resisting mechanical stress under carbon-limited conditions.},

Key measures of leaf mechanical resistance varied c. 500-800-fold among species. Contrary to a long-standing hypothesis, tropical leaves were not mechanically more resistant than temperate leaves. Leaf mechanical resistance was modestly related to rainfall and local light environment. By partitioning leaf mechanical resistance into three different components we discovered that toughness per density contributed a surprisingly large fraction to variation in mechanical resistance, larger than the fractions contributed by lamina thickness and tissue density. Higher toughness per density was associated with long leaf lifespan especially in forest understory. Seldom appreciated in the past, toughness per density is a key factor in leaf mechanical resistance, which itself influences plant-animal interactions and ecosystem functions across the globe.},

The power of soils versus climate in predicting leaf trait values is assessed in bivariate and multivariate analyses and is compared with the distribution of growth forms (as a discrete classification of vegetation) across gradients of soil fertility and climate. All continents except for Antarctica. Data on specific leaf area (SLA), leaf N concentration (LNC), leaf P concentration (LPC) and leaf N:P were collected for 474 species distributed across 99 sites (809 records), together with abiotic information from each study site. Individual and combined effects of soils and climate on leaf traits were quantified using maximum likelihood methods. Differences in occurrence of growth form across soil fertility and climate were determined by one-way ANOVA. There was a consistent increase in SLA, LNC and LPC with increasing soil fertility. SLA was related to proxies of N supply, LNC to both soil total N and P and LPC was only related to proxies of P supply. Soil nutrient measures explained more variance in leaf traits among sites than climate in bivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that climate interacted with soil nutrients for SLA and area-based LNC. Mass-based LNC and LPC were determined mostly by soil fertility, but soil P was highly correlated to precipitation. Relationships of leaf traits to soil nutrients were stronger than those of growth form versus soil nutrients. In contrast, climate determined distribution of growth form more strongly than it did leaf traits. We provide the first global quantification of the trade-off between traits associated with growth and resource conservation 'strategies' in relation to soil fertility. Precipitation but not temperature affected this trade-off. Continuous leaf traits might be better predictors of plant responses to nutrient supply than growth form, but growth forms reflect important aspects of plant species distribution with climate.},

The hydraulic architecture of trees can limit their water relations, gas exchange throughout the crown of trees, the distribution of trees over different habitats and, perhaps, even the maximum height that a particular species can achieve. Parameters of particular importance include: (1) the vulnerability of stems to drought-induced cavitation events because cavitation reduces the hydraulic conductance of stems, (2) the leaf specific conductivity of stems because it determines the pressure gradients and most negative water potentials needed to sustain evaporation from leaves, (3) the water storage capacity of tissues because this might determine the ability of trees to survive long drought periods. All of these parameters are determined by the structure and function of anatomical components of trees. Some of the ecological and physiological trade-offs of specific structures are discussed.},

  abstract = {Here, we analysed a wide range of literature data on the leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA). In nature, LMA varies more than 100-fold among species. Part of this variation (c. 35\%) can be ascribed to differences between functional groups, with evergreen species having the highest LMA, but most of the variation is within groups or biomes. When grown in the same controlled environment, leaf succulents and woody evergreen, perennial or slow-growing species have inherently high LMA. Within most of the functional groups studied, high-LMA species show higher leaf tissue densities. However, differences between evergreen and deciduous species result from larger volumes per area (thickness). Response curves constructed from experiments under controlled conditions showed that LMA varied strongly with light, temperature and submergence, moderately with CO2 concentration and nutrient and water stress, and marginally under most other conditions. Functional groups differed in the plasticity of LMA to these gradients. The physiological regulation is still unclear, but the consequences of variation in LMA and the suite of traits interconnected with it are strong. This trait complex is an important factor determining the fitness of species in their environment and affects various ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {*\textbackslash nThe leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water \textendash{} the third key resource \textendash stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n*\textbackslash nEvidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages).\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n*\textbackslash nThere are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n*\textbackslash nEconomic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up \textendash{} fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n*\textbackslash nSynthesis. Traits matter. A single `fast\textendash slow' plant economics spectrum that integrates across leaves, stems and roots is a key feature of the plant universe and helps to explain individual ecological strategies, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that accounting for intraspecific trait variation (ITV) may better address major questions in community ecology. However, a general picture of the relative extent of ITV compared to interspecific trait variation in plant communities is still missing. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of ITV within and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629 communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, ITV accounted for 25\% of the total trait variation within communities and 32\% of the total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent of ITV tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs. organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness) traits. The relative amount of ITV decreased with increasing species richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative importance of ITV in plant communities, providing practical guidelines for when researchers should include ITV in trait-based community and ecosystem studies.},

  abstract = {Light-saturated rates of photosynthesis on leaf area basis (A) depend not only on photosynthetic biochemistry but also on mesophyll structure. Because resistance to CO2 diffusion from the substomatal cavity to the stroma is substantial, it is likely that mesophyll structure affects A through affecting diffusion of CO2 in the leaf. To evaluate effects of various aspects of mesophyll structure on photosynthesis, we constructed a one-dimensional model of CO2 diffusion in the leaf. When mesophyll thickness of the leaf is changed with the Rubisco content per unit leaf area kept constant, the maximum A occurs at an almost identical mesophyll thickness irrespective of the Rubisco contents per leaf area. On the other hand, with an increase in Rubisco content per leaf area, the mesophyll thickness that realizes a given photosynthetic gain per mesophyll thickness (or per leaf cost) increases This probably explains the strong relationship between A and mesephyll thickness. In these simulations, an increase in mesophyll thickness simultaneously means an increase in the diffusional resistance in the intercellular spaces (R-ias), an increase in the total surface area of chloroplasts facing the intercellular spaces per unit leaf area (S-c), and an increase in construction and maintenance cost of the leaf. Leaves can increase S-c and decrease R-ias also by decreasing cell size. Leaves with smaller cells are mechanically stronger. However,actual leaves do not have very small cells. This could be because actual leaves exhibiting considerable rates of leaf area expansion, adequate heat capacitance, high efficiency of N and/or P use, etc, are favoured. Relationships between leaf longevity and mesophyll structure are also discussed.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT To arrive at a better understanding of variation in specific leaf mass (SLM, leaf weight per unit leaf area), we investigated the chemical composition and anatomical structure of the leaves of 14 grass species varying in potential relative growth rate. Expressed on a dry weight basis, the fast-growing grass species with low SLM contained relatively more minerals and organic N-compounds, whereas slow-growing species with high SLM contained more (hemi)cellulose and lignin. However, when expressed per unit leaf area, organic N-compounds, (hemi)cellulose, total structural carbohydrates and organic acids increased with increasing SLM. For the 14 grasses, no trend with SLM was found for the leaf volume per unit leaf area. Leaf density was positively correlated with SLM. Variation in density was not caused by variation in the proportion of intercellular spaces. The proportion of the total volume occupied by mesophyll and veins did not differ either. A high SLM was caused, at least partly, by a high proportion of non-veinal sclerenchymatic cells per cross-section. The epidermal cell area was negatively correlated with SLM. We conclude that the differences in SLM and in the relative growth rate (RGR) between fast- and slow-growing grass species are based partly on variation in anatomical differentiation and partly on chemical differences within cell types.},

LMA can be explained by variation in leaf thickness and/or density, both of which are influenced by anatomical tissue composition. The aim of this study is to quantify the anatomical characteristics that underlie variation in LMA in a range of woody species. \textbullet\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Twenty-six woody species, forming 13 species pairs with a deciduous and evergreen species from the same genus or family, were grown in a glasshouse. The youngest full-grown leaves were analyzed for LMA and morpho-anatomical characteristics at leaf, tissue, and cell level. \textbullet\textbackslash n\textbackslash nKEY RESULTS: Considered over all species studied, leaf thickness and density were equally important to explain the variation in LMA, but the class difference between deciduous and evergreen species was mainly determined by thickness, whereas variation within each group was largely due to density. Evergreens had thicker leaves, predominantly caused by a larger volume of mesophyll and air spaces, whereas the higher leaf density within each group was due to a lower proportion of epidermis and air spaces, and overall smaller cells. \textbullet\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: The anatomical basis for variation in LMA in woody species depends on the contrast made. Higher LMA in evergreens is mainly due to a greater leaf thickness, caused by a larger volume of mesophyll and air spaces. Within deciduous species and evergreens, higher LMA is caused by a higher density, due to higher volumetric fractions of mesophyll and lower fractions of air spaces and epidermis.},

  abstract = {Background Investigating the causes and consequences of intraspecific trait variation (ITV) in plants is not novel, as it has long been recognized that such variation shapes biotic and abiotic interactions. While evolutionary and population biology have extensively investigated ITV, only in the last 10 years has interest in ITV surged within community and comparative ecology. Scope Despite this recent interest, still lacking are thorough descriptions of ITV's extent, the spatial and temporal structure of ITV, and stronger connections between ITV and community and ecosystem properties. Our primary aim in this review is to synthesize the recent literature and ask: (1) How extensive is intraspecific variation in traits across scales, and what underlying mechanisms drive this variation? (2) How does this variation impact higher-order ecological processes (e.g. population dynamics, community assembly, invasion, ecosystem productivity)? (3) What are the consequences of ignoring ITV and how can these be mitigated? and (4) What are the most pressing research questions, and how can current practices be modified to suit our research needs? Our secondary aim is to target diverse and underrepresented traits and plant organs, including anatomy, wood, roots, hydraulics, reproduction and secondary chemistry. In addressing these aims, we showcase papers from the Special Issue. Conclusions Plant ITV plays a key role in determining individual and population performance, species interactions, community structure and assembly, and ecosystem properties. Its extent varies widely across species, traits and environments, and it remains difficult to develop a predictive model for ITV that is broadly applicable. Systematically characterizing the sources (e.g. ontogeny, population differences) of ITV will be a vital step forward towards identifying generalities and the underlying mechanisms that shape ITV. While the use of species means to link traits to higher-order processes may be appropriate in many cases, such approaches can obscure potentially meaningful variation. We urge the reporting of individual replicates and population means in online data repositories, a greater consideration of the mechanisms that enhance and constrain ITV's extent, and studies that span sub-disciplines.},

Leaf area, mass, LSM, density and thickness varied greatly between leaves on the same plant, different species, and with different nutrient, moisture and light regimes. In some cases, variations in LSM were due to changes in leaf density in particular or thickness or both, while in others, density and thickness varied without a net effect on LSM. At lower nutrient or moisture availabilities or at higher light irradiances, leaves tended to be smaller, with higher LSM, density and thickness. Under increased stress, the thickness (diameter) of needle leaves decreased despite an increase in LSM. We concluded that, while LSM is a useful measure of sclerophylly, its separation into leaf density and thickness may be more appropriate as they often vary independently and appear to be more responsive to environmental gradients than LSM.},

  abstract = {Intraspecific trait variation (ITV) is common feature of natural communities and has gained increasing attention due to its significant ecological effects on community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. However, the estimation of ITV per se has yet to receive much attention, despite the need for accurate ITV estimation for trait-based ecological inferences. It remains unclear if, and to what extent, current estimations of ITV are biased. The most common method used to quantify ITV is the coefficient of variation (CV), which is dimensionless and can therefore be compared across traits, species, and studies. Here, we asked which CV estimator and data normalization method are optimal for quantifying ITV, and further identified the minimum sample size required for {$\pm$}5\% accuracy assuming a completely random sample scheme. To these ends, we compared the performance of four existing CV estimators, together with new simple composite estimators, across different data normalizations, and sample sizes using both a simulated and empirical trait datasets from local to regional scales. Our results consistently showed that the most commonly used ITV estimator (CV1= {$\sigma$}sample/{$\mu$}sample), often underestimated ITV\textemdash in some cases by nearly 50\%\textemdash and that underestimation varies largely among traits and species. The extent of this bias depends on the sample size, skewness and kurtosis of the trait value distribution. The bias in ITV can be substantially reduced by using log-transforming trait data and alternative CV estimators that take into consideration the above dependencies. We find that the CV4 estimator, also known as Bao's CV estimator, combined with log data normalization, exhibits the lowest bias and can reach {$\pm$}5\% accuracy with sample sizes greater than 20 for almost all examined traits and species. These results demonstrated that many previous ITV measurements may be substantially underestimated and, further, that these underestimations are not equal among species and traits even using the same sample size. These problems can be largely solved by log-transforming trait data first and then using the Bao's CV to quantify ITV. Together, our findings facilitate a more accurate understanding of ITV in community structures and dynamics, and may also benefit studies in other research areas that depend on accurate estimation of CV.},
