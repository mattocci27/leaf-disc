# Appendix S3:

Generalization for a relationship between ratios of disc-based and whole-leaf-based estimates of leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf tissue density (LD), and leaf thickness (LT).
For the *i* tree individual or species, the relationship between ratios of disc-based and whole-leaf estimates of LMA, LD, and LT is:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{LD_d}_i}{\mathrm{LD_w}_i} = \frac{\mathrm{LMA_d}_i}{\mathrm{LMA_w}_i} \frac{\mathrm{LT_w}_i}{\mathrm{LT_d}_i}
$$

where *d* indicates disc-based estimates, *w* indicates whole-leaf based estimates.

Because thickness is measured on leaf lamina whether one uses a leaf disc or a whole-leaf, the expected ratio between thickness for a leaf disc and a whole-leaf should be 1.
The above relationship, therefore, can be rewritten using lognormally distributed multiplicative error ($\epsilon_i$) on the arithmetic scale:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{LD_d}_i}{\mathrm{LD_w}_i} = \frac{\mathrm{LMA_d}_i}{\mathrm{LMA_w}_i} exp(\epsilon_i) \;\;\;\;\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2).
$$

LMA requires two times measurements (mass and area) and LD requires three time measurements (mass, area and thickness), and thus variance in the ratio of whole-leaf LD and leaf disc LD should be greater than that of LMA.

As we expected LD, showed the slightly smaller *R*^2^ value than LMA (Figure below) in the Yunnan dataset.
We have independent measurement for thickness for leaf discs and whole-leaves in the Yunnan dataset.
If we use the same leaf thickness values for leaf discs and whole-leaves (i.e., LT~w*i*~/LT~d*i*~ = 1), the scatter plots will be identical for LMA and LD.
Consequently, we do not perform further analyses for LD, because differences between whole-leaf LD and leaf disc LD only depends on the ratio between whole-leaf LMA and leaf disc LMA and measurement errors of leaf thickness.
